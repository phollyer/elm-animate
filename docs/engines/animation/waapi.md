# WAAPI Engine

This page focuses on what makes this Engine different, read [Engines Overview](overview.md) for features that are shared across all Engines.

The WAAPI Engine uses the Web Animations API via Elm ports and a JavaScript companion. It combines browser-native performance with programmatic control.

## Setup

### Simplest - CDN, no bundler

??? example "View Source Code"

    ```html
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/elm-animate-waapi/dist/elm-animate-waapi.js"></script>
    <script>
        const app = Elm.Main.init({
            node: document.getElementById('app')
        });

        ElmAnimateWAAPI.init(app.ports);
    </script>
    ```


### NPM

=== "npm"
    ```bash
    npm install elm-animate-waapi
    ```

=== "yarn"
    ```bash
    yarn add elm-animate-waapi
    ```

??? example "View Source Code"

    ```javascript
    import ElmAnimateWAAPI from 'elm-animate-waapi';

    const app = Elm.Main.init({
        node: document.getElementById('app')
    });

    ElmAnimateWAAPI.init(app.ports);
    ```


### Define ports in Elm

The WAAPI engine uses just two ports - one for outgoing commands and one for incoming events:

??? example "View Source Code"

    ```elm
    port module Main exposing (main)

    import Json.Encode


    -- Outgoing port (Elm → JS): sends all animation commands
    port waapiCommand : Json.Encode.Value -> Cmd msg


    -- Incoming port (JS → Elm): receives all animation events
    port waapiEvent : (Json.Encode.Value -> msg) -> Sub msg
    ```

## Initialize

WAAPI's `init` requires the port functions as parameters:

??? example "View Source Code"

    ```elm
    init : ( Model, Cmd Msg )
    init =
        ( { animState =
                WAAPI.init waapiCommand waapiEvent
                    [ Opacity.init "fadeAnim" 0
                    , Translate.initXY "slideAnim" 100 50
                    ]
          }
        , Cmd.none
        )
    ```


## Trigger

The WAPPI engine has a `fireAndForget` function as well as `animate` to trigger animations.

The difference between the two is that `fireAndForget` is stateless.

If you want an animation to run without tracking its state — a one-shot effect where you don't need to pause, resume, query progress, or interrupt it later. WAAPI offers this via `fireAndForget`.

Unlike `animate`, `fireAndForget` takes the port function directly instead of `AnimState` — it doesn't need one. It returns a bare `Cmd msg` with no state to store.

??? example "View Source Code"

    ```elm
    port waapiCommand : Encode.Value -> Cmd msg

    update msg model =
        case msg of
            FlashNotification ->
                ( model
                , WAAPI.fireAndForget waapiCommand flashAnim
                )
    ```

This is useful for:

- **Decorative effects** — ripples, flashes, pulses that don't affect application logic
- **Notifications** — brief visual feedback that runs once and is done
- **Keeping your model lean** — no `AnimState` needed for throwaway animations

!!! warning "No state, no control"
    Since `fireAndForget` bypasses `AnimState`, you can't pause, resume, stop, restart, interrupt, or query these animations. If you need any of those, use `animate` instead.


## Subscriptions

The WAAPI Engine requires a subscription to receive animation events from JavaScript:

??? example "View Source Code"

    ```elm
    type Msg
        = GotAnimMsg WAAPI.AnimMsg
        | ...

    subscriptions : Model -> Sub Msg
    subscriptions model =
        WAAPI.subscriptions GotAnimMsg model.animState
    ```

Without this subscription, animations will still play visually in the browser, but Elm won't receive events — so your `AnimState` will be out of sync with what's actually happening on screen.

## Update

Handle animation messages in your update function. The `update` function returns the new state, and the corresponding event:

??? example "View Source Code"

    ```elm
    update : Msg -> Model -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )
    update msg model =
        case msg of
            GotAnimMsg animMsg ->
                let
                    ( animState, event ) =
                        WAAPI.update animMsg model.animState
                in
                handleEvent event { model | animState = animState }

            ...
    ```

## Interrupting Animations

Start a new animation at any time — the WAAPI Engine handles smooth transitions from the current position.

📖 See [Interrupting Animations](../../concepts/interruptions.md/) for more info.

## Animation Control

WAAPI control functions return both a new `AnimState` and a `Cmd` that sends commands to JavaScript:

??? example "View Source Code"

    ```elm
    update msg model =
        case msg of
            Pause ->
                let
                    ( newAnimState, cmd ) =
                        WAAPI.pause "box" model.animState
                in
                ( { model | animState = newAnimState }, cmd )

            Resume ->
                let
                    ( newAnimState, cmd ) =
                        WAAPI.resume "box" model.animState
                in
                ( { model | animState = newAnimState }, cmd )

            Stop ->
                let
                    ( newAnimState, cmd ) =
                        WAAPI.stop "box" model.animState
                in
                ( { model | animState = newAnimState }, cmd )

            Reset ->
                let
                    ( newAnimState, cmd ) =
                        WAAPI.reset "box" model.animState
                in
                ( { model | animState = newAnimState }, cmd )

            Restart ->
                let
                    ( newAnimState, cmd ) =
                        WAAPI.restart "box" model.animState
                in
                ( { model | animState = newAnimState }, cmd )
    ```
